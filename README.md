This repository contains the pipelines and scripts used in Manahan and Nachman 2023, "Alternative splicing and environmental adaptaion in house mice."

RNA-Seq data is from Mack et al. 2018 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA407812, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA407812).  Exome-capture data is from Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018 (NCIB BioProject PRJNA397150, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA397150) 

- Generating references for read mapping and differential splicing analysis (GRCm38 and GRCm39)

- Processing raw data: trimming, quality check, read mapping

- Differential splicing analysis (from Li et al. 2018, https://davidaknowles.github.io/leafcutter/articles/Usage.html)
 
- Identification of clinally varying splicing events from differentially spliced clusters

- _cis_-sQTL associated with clinal variation in splicing

- Overlap between genes with _cis_-sQTL and signatures of selection
